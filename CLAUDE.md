# CLAUDE.md -- AutoSwarm Office

## Critical Paths

- `apps/nexus-api/src/main.py` -- FastAPI application entry point
- `apps/office-ui/src/app/page.tsx` -- Office UI root page
- `packages/orchestrator/src/orchestrator.py` -- Swarm orchestration engine
- `packages/permissions/src/matrix.py` -- HITL permission matrix
- `packages/permissions/src/engine.py` -- Permission evaluation engine
- `packages/inference/src/router.py` -- LLM model routing logic

## Port Assignments

| Port | Service | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 4300 | nexus-api | Central API |
| 4301 | office-ui | Next.js frontend |
| 4302 | admin | Admin dashboard |
| 4303 | colyseus | Game state server |

These ports do not conflict with Janua (4100-4104) or Enclii (4200-4204).

## MADFAM Ecosystem

- **Janua** handles all authentication. Never implement custom auth. Use the
  `get_current_user` dependency in FastAPI and the Next.js middleware for session
  validation. Janua tokens are JWTs with `sub`, `email`, `roles`, and `org_id` claims.

- **Dhanam** handles billing and subscriptions. Compute token budgets are enforced
  by the orchestrator package and tracked in the `compute_token_ledger` table.
  Use the billing router at `apps/nexus-api/src/routers/billing.py`.

- **Enclii** handles deployment. The `.enclii.yml` defines all three services.
  The `deploy-enclii.yml` GitHub Actions workflow builds images and notifies Enclii.

- Read sibling repo `llms-full.txt` files for full API surfaces of Janua, Dhanam,
  and Enclii.

## Coding Standards

### Python
- **Linter**: ruff (target py312, line-length 100)
- **Type checker**: mypy (strict mode)
- **Models**: pydantic for all request/response schemas
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async sessions
- **Tests**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Imports**: isort via ruff, `autoswarm` as known-first-party

### TypeScript
- **Strict mode**: enabled in all tsconfig.json files
- **Linter**: ESLint with shared config from `packages/config/eslint`
- **Formatter**: Prettier
- **Tests**: vitest with jsdom + @testing-library/react for UI components
- **Build**: Turborepo for monorepo orchestration
- **Package manager**: pnpm with workspace protocol

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches only -- never commit directly to `main`.
- Conventional commits enforced by commitlint:
  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`
- PRs require CI to pass before merge.

## Skills System

The `packages/skills/` package implements the AgentSkills standard.

- **Core skills** (11) live in `packages/skills/skill-definitions/`. Always loaded.
- **Community skills** (~25) live in `packages/skills/community-skills/`. Vendored from
  [ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills).
  Disabled by default.
- `SkillTier` enum: `CORE` | `COMMUNITY`. Set by the registry during discovery, not
  from YAML frontmatter.
- Enable community skills via:
  - Env var: `AUTOSWARM_COMMUNITY_SKILLS_ENABLED=true`
  - Runtime: `get_skill_registry().enable_community_skills()`
  - REST API: `POST /api/v1/skills/community/enable`
- Core skills always take precedence on name collision with community skills.
- Community skill scripts under `community-skills/` are excluded from ruff linting
  via `extend-exclude` in `pyproject.toml`.

## Architecture Notes

- The Redis queue key is `autoswarm:tasks` (LPUSH to enqueue, BRPOP to dequeue).
- WebSocket approval events use the `ConnectionManager` singleton in
  `apps/nexus-api/src/ws.py`.
- LangGraph `interrupt()` is used to pause agent execution for HITL approval.
- Synergy bonuses stack multiplicatively (see `packages/orchestrator/src/synergy.py`).
  Synergy rules support both role-based (`required_roles`) and skill-based
  (`required_skills`) requirements.
- `SwarmOrchestrator.match_agents_by_skills()` selects idle agents by skill overlap
  score. The swarms router auto-selects agents when `required_skills` is provided
  without explicit `assigned_agent_ids`.
- Agents have `skill_ids` (JSON column) and `effective_skills` (computed from
  `skill_ids` or `DEFAULT_ROLE_SKILLS` fallback). Skills flow from DB → API →
  Colyseus schema → Phaser UI badges.
- The gateway `HeartbeatService` scrapes GitHub events and dispatches enemy waves
  via WebSocket to the approvals endpoint, which converts them into `SwarmTask`
  records enqueued on Redis.
- Worker graph nodes (`plan`, `implement`, `review`) use `call_llm()` from
  `autoswarm_workers.inference` with a `ModelRouter` that auto-discovers providers
  from env vars. Graphs fall back to static logic when no LLM is configured.
- The permission matrix is evaluated by `packages/permissions/src/engine.py` before
  every tool invocation in the worker.

## Sprite Assets

- Pre-generated pixel-art PNGs live in `apps/office-ui/public/assets/` (sprites,
  tilesets, UI icons). These are committed to the repo.
- Regenerate with `make generate-assets` (runs `scripts/generate-assets.js` using
  `@napi-rs/canvas`).
- `BootScene.ts` loads sprite files with automatic canvas-rectangle fallback if any
  PNG fails to load. Department zone overlays are always canvas-generated.
- `OfficeScene.ts` plays walk animations for the Tactician (4 dirs x 3 frames) and
  idle/working animations for agents.
